The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Tony McDade; the skewed media and social media coverage;  the Zoom-bombing for the purpose of spewing racist, sexist, and homophobic speech are the most recent examples of long-standing systematic racial injustice and oppression. The strain our communities is further compounded by the many losses brought on by COVID-19.  There is an individual and collective toll on us all due to the accumulation of these events and many communities of color and their allies have been pushed to their breaking points.   We are in the midst of a collective grief response, as demonstrated by the anger we see reflected in the protests and cries for justice in the cities across the country.  The loss of life, of agency, and of connection can feel overwhelming.  \n\nThese collective traumas have very real psychological consequences, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic disorder, and the exacerbation of other underlying mental health and substance abuse issues. We also recognize the particular impact witnessing these traumatic events has on members of our Black and African-American community. By sharing and acknowledging our grief and hurt we can each help each other bear the pain and emotional weight.  Take the time to check on those you care about, take the time to care for yourself, and reach out if you need support or assistance supporting someone else.
