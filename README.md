## Features still outstanding:
- Better font pairings (Title text is fine, body/heading text pair needs to be changed)
- Header text "COVID-19 University Response Consolidation" to shrink to "Curecon" after N seconds

- Landing Call To Action Text to cycle through multiple languages
- Landing Call To Action "your school" animated underline resembling sharpie/pencil after a short delay
- Landing Form should have fixed size elements (inputs overlapping on zoom / small screens)

- Map Pins for each university in universityData.json
- Map Pin Popup information card to pull from universityData.json fields
- Map initial location/zoom to be finalized

- SchoolsList links (curecon.org/school/{schoolName}) needs to be set up to handle no schoolName part

- Footer looks a bit funny, can definitely improve link cluster layout / background color

- About page, School Data Page, Submission Page need to be made, routes needs to be set-up
- Submission of form data to DB needs to be configured
